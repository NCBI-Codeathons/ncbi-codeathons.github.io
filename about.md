## Goal/What is an NCBI Hackathon

An amazing event where researchers and coders from a variety of backgrounds have the unique opportunity to work together and create tools and tutorial pipelines that solve relevant problems for the biomedical community.  The key to our hackathons is the focus on collaboration.  Over three days each team works on a different scientific problem with an emphasis on sharing expertise and insights throughout the event.
